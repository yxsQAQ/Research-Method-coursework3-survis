  abstract = {Urban mobility is a vital aspect of any city and often influences its physical shape as well as
its level of economic and social development. A thorough analysis of mobility patterns in
urban areas can provide various benefits, such as the prediction of traffic flow and public
transportation usage. In particular, based on its exceptional ability to extract patterns from
complex large-scale data, embedding based on deep learning is a promising method for
analyzing the mobility patterns of urban residents. However, as urban mobility becomes
increasingly complex, it becomes difficult to embed patterns into a single vector because of
its limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing urban mobility
based on deep learning. The proposed method involves clustering mobility patterns and
embedding them to capture their implicit meaning. Clustering groups mobility patterns
based on their spatiotemporal characteristics, and embedding provides meaningful information regarding both individual residents (i.e., personalized mobility) and all residents as a
whole, enabling a more effective analysis of mobility patterns. Experiments were performed
to predict the successive points of interest (POIs) based on transportation data collected
from 1.5 million citizens in a large metropolitan city; the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves top-1, 3, and 5 accuracies of 73.64%, 88.65%, and 91.54%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the conventional method (59.48%, 75.85%, and
80.1%, respectively). We also demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates the analysis
of urban mobility through arithmetic operations between POI vectors.}

  keywords = {Review paper, Meta-analysis, Deep learning in transportation, Machine learning, Prediction accuracy},
  abstract = {Deep learning methods are being increasingly applied in transport studies, while the methods require modellers to go through 
a try-and-error model tuning process particularly on choosing neural network structure. Moreover, the accuracy level also 
depends on other factors such as the type of data, sample size, region of data collection, and time of prediction. To efciently 
facilitate such a model tuning process, this study attempts to summarize the relationship between the prediction accuracy of 
deep learning models and the factors which infuence it. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature by adopting 
a detailed search strategy, followed by a meta-analysis on prediction accuracy. Four separate linear mixed efects models, 
taking into account unobserved heterogeneities in prediction accuracy across studies, were developed to statistically test the 
impacts of infuential factors on prediction accuracy for (a) all observations (136 studies; 2314 cases), (b) studies with MAPE, 
MRE, and average accuracy indicators (86 studies; 1,878 cases), (c) classifcation-based studies with accuracy indicator (29 
studies; 220 cases), and (d) trafc forecasting studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (36 studies, 991 
cases). The fnal model includes additional factors to test the infuence of sample size and time horizon of prediction variables. 
The fndings showed that, as expected, deep learning models, particularly ones that consider spatiotemporal dependencies 
of transport phenomena, show better prediction accuracies compared to conventional machine learning models. We also 
found that, on average, the prediction accuracy is improved by 5.90% with 100 million additional data, while the accuracy is 
reduced by 5.28% with 100 min increase in time horizon of prediction in trafc forecasting studies. We concluded this paper 
with a comprehensive summary of the existing fndings on the applications of deep learning to transport studies.}

abstract = {Nowadays, tremendous data, are continuously gathering from the smart card in public transport domain. Such data, conveying two viable distinct information, can ensue designing intelligent transportation. More specifically, users behavior in a public transport system, can be investigated, as one of the data mining and machine learning applications. The first component of the data, provides the spatial feature, indicates the geographical coordinates of bus stops or subway stations. The second component of the data, deals with the temporal feature, being the time of the trips that public transport is used. Hence, it is necessary to distill the data, in order to get the advantages of the data analysis techniques and extract the essential knowledge from the data. Due to the massive data storage and the diversity of the data analysis methods, various challenges are arisen during the process of exploiting the hidden patterns of the data. We review a couple of scenarios and suggest a solution to overcome a number of the raised challenges. Moreover, the other aspects of this problem, are remaining as the open problems for the future research.}

  author={Palacio, Sebasti{\'a}n M},
  journal={XREAP WP},
  volume={3},
  year={2018},
  abstract = {Public transport smart cards are widely used around the world. However, while they 
provide information about various aspects of passenger behavior, they have not been 
properly exploited to predict demand. Indeed, traditional methods in economics 
employ linear unbiased estimators that pay little attention to accuracy, which is the 
main problem faced by the sector’s regulators. This paper reports the application of 
various supervised machine learning (SML) techniques to smart card data in order to 
forecast demand, and it compares these outcomes with traditional linear model 
estimates. We conclude that the forecasts obtained from these algorithms are much 
more accurate.}

abstract = {The planning of attractive and cost efficient public transport schedules, i.e., timetables and corresponding vehicle schedules is a highly complex optimization process involving many steps. Integrating robustness from a passenger’s point of view makes the task even more challenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in the literature, a standard way to evaluate the robustness of a public transport system is to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios. Unfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we therefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation by using regression models from machine learning. Training of these models is based on carefully selected key features of public transport systems and passenger demand. The trained model is then able to predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only its key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that approximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as black box to increase the robustness of public transport schedules. We provide a first proof of concept for the special case of robust timetabling, using a local search framework. In computational experiments with different benchmark instances we demonstrate an excellent quality of our predictions.}

considers the fuel cost and gas emission from transportation. The analysis of the experiment shows
that the ANN outperformed the SVM. Furthermore, a recommender system is used to recommend
suitable routes for the chosen scenario. The experiments extend the discussion with a range of future

  abstract = {Crowding in city public transportation systems is a primary issue that causes delay in
the mobility of passengers. Moreover, scheduled and unscheduled events in a city lead to excess
crowding situations at the metro or bus stations. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices could be used
for data collection, which are related to crowding situations in a smart city. The fog computing data
centers located in different zones of a smart city can process and analyze the collected data to assist
the passengers how to commute smoothly with minimum waiting time in the crowded situation.
In this paper, Q-learning based passengers assistance system is designed to assist the commuters in
finding less crowded bus and metro stations to avoid long queues of waiting. The traffic congestion
and crowded situation data are processed in the fog computing data centers. From our experimental
results, it is found that our proposed method can achieve higher reward values, which can be used to
minimize the passengers’ waiting time with minimum computational delay as compared to the cloud
computing platform.}
