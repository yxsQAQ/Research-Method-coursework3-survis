As the most important content of bus service reliability, accurate bus arrival prediction can improve travel efficiency for enabling a reliable and convenient transportation system. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel deep learning method, i.e. variational mode decomposition long short-term memory (VMD-LSTM), for bus travel speed prediction in urban traffic networks using a forecast of bus arrival information on variable time horizons. The method uses the temporal and spatial patterns of the average bus speed series. The results show that the VMD-LSTM model outperforms other models on forecasting bus link speed series in future time intervals, whereas the artificial neural network model achieves the worst prediction.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, tremendous data, are continuously gathering from the smart card in public transport domain. Such data, conveying two viable distinct information, can ensue designing intelligent transportation. More specifically, users behavior in a public transport system, can be investigated, as one of the data mining and machine learning applications. The first component of the data, provides the spatial feature, indicates the geographical coordinates of bus stops or subway stations. The second component of the data, deals with the temporal feature, being the time of the trips that public transport is used. Hence, it is necessary to distill the data, in order to get the advantages of the data analysis techniques and extract the essential knowledge from the data. Due to the massive data storage and the diversity of the data analysis methods, various challenges are arisen during the process of exploiting the hidden patterns of the data. We review a couple of scenarios and suggest a solution to overcome a number of the raised challenges. Moreover, the other aspects of this problem, are remaining as the open problems for the future research.",

        "abstract": "The planning of attractive and cost efficient public transport schedules, i.e., timetables and corresponding vehicle schedules is a highly complex optimization process involving many steps. Integrating robustness from a passenger\u2019s point of view makes the task even more challenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in the literature, a standard way to evaluate the robustness of a public transport system is to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios. Unfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we therefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation by using regression models from machine learning. Training of these models is based on carefully selected key features of public transport systems and passenger demand. The trained model is then able to predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only its key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that approximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as black box to increase the robustness of public transport schedules. We provide a first proof of concept for the special case of robust timetabling, using a local search framework. In computational experiments with different benchmark instances we demonstrate an excellent quality of our predictions.",

        "abstract": "Urban mobility is a vital aspect of any city and often influences its physical shape as well as its level of economic and social development. A thorough analysis of mobility patterns in urban areas can provide various benefits, such as the prediction of traffic flow and public transportation usage. In particular, based on its exceptional ability to extract patterns from complex large-scale data, embedding based on deep learning is a promising method for analyzing the mobility patterns of urban residents. However, as urban mobility becomes increasingly complex, it becomes difficult to embed patterns into a single vector because of its limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing urban mobility based on deep learning. The proposed method involves clustering mobility patterns and embedding them to capture their implicit meaning. Clustering groups mobility patterns based on their spatiotemporal characteristics, and embedding provides meaningful informa\u0002tion regarding both individual residents (i.e., personalized mobility) and all residents as a whole, enabling a more effective analysis of mobility patterns. Experiments were performed to predict the successive points of interest (POIs) based on transportation data collected from 1.5 million citizens in a large metropolitan city; the results demonstrate that the pro\u0002posed method achieves top-1, 3, and 5 accuracies of 73.64%, 88.65%, and 91.54%, respec\u0002tively, which are much higher than those of the conventional method (59.48%, 75.85%, and 80.1%, respectively). We also demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates the analysis of urban mobility through arithmetic operations between POI vectors.",

        "abstract": "Crowding in city public transportation systems is a primary issue that causes delay in the mobility of passengers. Moreover, scheduled and unscheduled events in a city lead to excess crowding situations at the metro or bus stations. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices could be used for data collection, which are related to crowding situations in a smart city. The fog computing data centers located in different zones of a smart city can process and analyze the collected data to assist the passengers how to commute smoothly with minimum waiting time in the crowded situation. In this paper, Q-learning based passengers assistance system is designed to assist the commuters in finding less crowded bus and metro stations to avoid long queues of waiting. The traffic congestion and crowded situation data are processed in the fog computing data centers. From our experimental results, it is found that our proposed method can achieve higher reward values, which can be used to minimize the passengers\u2019 waiting time with minimum computational delay as compared to the cloud computing platform.",

Moreover, the smart transportation concept is an integrated application of technology and strategy in the transportation system. Using smart idea is the key to the application of the Internet of Things. The ways to improve the management transportation system become a bottleneck for the traditional data analytics solution, one of the answers used in machine learning. This paper uses the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for the best prediction of travel time with a lower error rate on a case study of a university shuttle bus. Apart from predicting the travel time, this study also considers the fuel cost and gas emission from transportation. The analysis of the experiment shows that the ANN outperformed the SVM. Furthermore, a recommender system is used to recommend suitable routes for the chosen scenario. The experiments extend the discussion with a range of future directions on the stipulated field of study.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning methods are being increasingly applied in transport studies, while the methods require modellers to go through a try-and-error model tuning process particularly on choosing neural network structure. Moreover, the accuracy level also depends on other factors such as the type of data, sample size, region of data collection, and time of prediction. To efciently facilitate such a model tuning process, this study attempts to summarize the relationship between the prediction accuracy of deep learning models and the factors which infuence it. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature by adopting a detailed search strategy, followed by a meta-analysis on prediction accuracy. Four separate linear mixed efects models, taking into account unobserved heterogeneities in prediction accuracy across studies, were developed to statistically test the impacts of infuential factors on prediction accuracy for (a) all observations (136 studies; 2314 cases), (b) studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (86 studies; 1,878 cases), (c) classifcation-based studies with accuracy indicator (29 studies; 220 cases), and (d) trafc forecasting studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (36 studies, 991 cases). The fnal model includes additional factors to test the infuence of sample size and time horizon of prediction variables. The fndings showed that, as expected, deep learning models, particularly ones that consider spatiotemporal dependencies of transport phenomena, show better prediction accuracies compared to conventional machine learning models. We also found that, on average, the prediction accuracy is improved by 5.90% with 100 million additional data, while the accuracy is reduced by 5.28% with 100 min increase in time horizon of prediction in trafc forecasting studies. We concluded this paper with a comprehensive summary of the existing fndings on the applications of deep learning to transport studies.",
